fit darktable parameters to given before/after image pair.
================================================================================

before:
input.pfm (linear rgb)

after:
reference.pfm (srgb)

output will be written to:
output.pfm (srgb, processed image)
input.xmp (fitted parameters)


depends on:
- compiled levmar-2.6 in a subdirectory levmar-2.6/
  (might depend on f2c, libblas-dev and liblapack-dev)
- rm (command line tool)
- darktable-cli


example usage:
================================================================================

make
./unitylut

open unity.pfm in darktable and store it unchanged as unity_ldr_srgb.png
(e.g. set input and output color profile to the same thing, for example linear rgb)

process unity_ldr_srgb.png in gimp or gmic to get your desired look (apply film
emulation preset). store the result as reference.png

open reference.png in darktable and store unchanged as reference.pfm
(e.g. by setting both input and output profiles to srgb)

open unity.pfm in darktable and store it as input.pfm, converting srgb to linear
rgb on the way (i.e. set input profile to srgb, output to linear rgb).

./fit
get coffee

apply input.xmp to your jpg/raw and hdr images :)



to download and process all g'mic film emulation presets:
================================================================================

- go to gimp g'mic, find `download all presets' button in the film emulation menu
- after download, find all appropriately named cluts as .cimgz in ~/.gmic_film_presets/
  at the time of this writing it gets them from:
  http://gmic.sourceforge.net/data_film_presets/*.cimgz
